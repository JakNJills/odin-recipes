        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baozi(包子) is an extremely  popular and favorite of many around the world. Not to be confused with jiaozi(another famous and popular Chinese Bao), the Baozi is a  stuffed steamed bun. These buns are soft, fluffy, and  stuffed with either  meat, vegetables, sweetened red bean paste, or soup as the filling. This recipe will focus on helping you make stuffed pork steamed buns which are probably the most commonly made version. There is a legend behind the creation of Baozi. It is told that Zhang Liang created Baozi as a tribute to give to the gods or he used them to bribe a River God for his soldiers safety. Whether that is true or not scholars do believe they were created during the Han Dynasty in North China in the Xinjiang Province. Over time and distance the recipe has changed in several different ways.Warning if you continue with this recipe you will be  making buns from scratch with this recipe. So you have been notified. Now get your mixers ready! </p>
